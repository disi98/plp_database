# PLP Database Assignments

This repository contains the SQL assignments for the PLP (Programming Languages and Paradigms) course. Each week’s folder holds the SQL scripts and supporting README for that week’s exercises, covering normal forms, joins, subqueries, and other fundamental database concepts.

## Prerequisites
- MySQL (or any compatible SQL database engine)
- SQL client or command-line access to run `.sql` scripts

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/disi98/plp_database.git>
   ```
2. Navigate into the workspace:
   ```bash
   cd plp_database
   ```
3. For each week (1–7):
   - Open the `week X/answers.sql` file in your SQL client
   - Review the queries and execute them against your test database
   - Consult `week X/README.md` for context and explanations of each question
